# Project Concept
## Project 1
I chose the poem The South is Like Shakespeare by Chinese American Poet Yu Xinqiao as the material for my visualization. This poem was also used as lyrics for a song after the same name by Chinese musician Moxi Zishi, who I once worked with on this album. The poem depicts a fascinating landscape of south China with the memory of youth love. I love both the poem and the song at the first sight, so I decide to use the song as the background music for the visual storytelling.
There are going to be 5-6 main scenes according to the structure of the poem. By the visual elements of river, bridge, rain, mists, fountain, starlight, kites, red umbrella, handkerchief, young girls, swallow, bee hive and so on, I will create a beautiful sweet and touching animation in order to tell a poetic story.

## Project 2
To continue working on the topic of Deception, I want to use the Google Trend API to pull out the search trend of the word "Truth" over time worldwide. The result gives a relative popularity value(from 0 to 100) of selected region during the selected time range. I'm about to use the worldwide each data point in the past 24 hours to form an iceburg/diamond-like sculpture, which represents transparency and sharpness. The user will be able to see the time information of the peak point, which represents the highest demand of truth. Users are also able to change the time range and the sculpture will change accordingly. 
By this "digital installation", I want to make the statement that: the journey of pursuing the truth could be exhuasting and dangerous, but the timeless value of the precious truth always draws us towards it, and the search for truth will never stop.

An example program running.

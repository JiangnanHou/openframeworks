# Project Concept
## Project 1: The South is Like Shakespeare
I chose the poem The South is Like Shakespeare by Chinese American Poet Yu Xinqiao as the material for my visualization. This poem was also used as lyrics for a song after the same name by Chinese musician Moxi Zishi, who I once worked with on this album. The poem depicts a fascinating landscape of south China with the memory of youth love. I love both the poem and the song at the first sight, so I decide to use the song as the background music for the visual storytelling.

There are going to be 5-6 main scenes according to the structure of the poem. By the visual elements of river, bridge, rain, mists, fountain, starlight, kites, red umbrella, handkerchief, young girls, swallow, bee hive and so on, I will create a beautiful sweet and touching animation in order to tell a poetic story. It supposed to give a glimpse of the romance in Chinese culture for both Chinese and non-Chinese audience.

## Project 2: Truth to Tell
To continue working on the topic of Deception, I want to use the Google Trend API to pull out the search trend of the word "Truth" over time worldwide. The result gives a relative popularity value(from 0 to 100) of selected region during the selected time range. I'm about to use the worldwide each data point in the past 24 hours to form an iceburg/diamond-like sculpture, which represents transparency and sharpness. The user will be able to see the time information of the peak point, which represents the highest demand of truth. Users are also able to change the time range and the sculpture will change accordingly. 

This work is meant for all the people living in this post-truth era. By this "digital installation", I want to make a statement that: the journey of pursuing the truth could be exhuasting and dangerous, but the timeless value of the precious truth always draws us towards it, and the search for truth will never stop.


## Project 3: Building Zobeide
The story background of the game is a story from Italo Calvino's book Invisible Cities. In a chapter of Cities & Desire, a story of Zobeide goes like this: some men had the same dream of a naked woman running at night through an unknown city. They dreamed of pursuing her but each of them lost her. The next day, they decided to build a city modeled on the one in their dream but arranged spaces and walls differently, so she would be unable to escape again. Everyday, they went the same walk they did in their dream with the hope and belief they would see the girl, but no one saw that girl ever again, neither in their sleep nor when they were awake. At the end of the story, new men, who have also dreamed of the elusive woman, come to Zobeide and redesign it so that the woman will not be able to escape at the point where she did in their dreams. They cannot understand what drew the original settlers to Zobeide, “this ugly city, this trap”. 

In the game, users are going see a woman running away and vanish at some point. Users need to build roads to the point and set up tall walls to prevent the woman from running away again. The woman will reapear at another location after the user finishes building, so the chase is going to be endless. The users will never catch the woman, but seeing the labyrinth, the trap they've been building over time, they are supposed to catch a reflection of their ugly desires, the selfishness and blindness. This game is meant for anyone who enjoys a reflective story, a game not for winning.

## Project 2
To continue working on the topic of Deception, I want to use the Google Trend API to pull out the search trend of the word "Truth" over time worldwide. The result gives a relative popularity value(from 0 to 100) of selected region during the selected time range. I'm about to use the worldwide each data point in the past 24 hours to form an iceburg/diamond-like sculpture, which represents transparency and sharpness. The user will be able to see the time information of the peak point, which represents the highest demand of truth. Users are also able to change the time range and the sculpture will change accordingly. 
By this "digital installation", I want to make the statement that: the journey of pursuing the truth could be exhuasting and dangerous, but the timeless value of the precious truth always draws us towards it, and the search for truth will never stop.

An example program running.

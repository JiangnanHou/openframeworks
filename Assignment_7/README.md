# Assignment 7:
## Project 1 Scene 1
![](/img/a7.jpeg)
I built scene 0 for my project 1: Building Zobeideit in the last assignment. This week I kept working on it and tweaking my objects with gui and matrix.

After pressing arrow key down twice, scene 0 ends with the disapearance of the title elements and then scene 1 starts. The text moves from bottom to center and a skein of lines is being generated. The voiceover starts to play as well.

For the gui part, we can :
Drag "volume" slider to change the voiceover volume;
Drag the "x" and "y" under "location" slider to change the skein's x and y location; 
Drag "scale" to change its size; 
Drag "rotate" to to rotate it by Y axis (it's also being rotated along X axis automatically); 
Drag "background gradient" to change the background gradient color;
Click "restart" to go back  to scene 0.

![](/img/a8.png)
I use current temperature, wind speed, pressure, current time and sunrise time today in New York to tweak the visualization. 

1. Wind speed is controlling the speed in gui;
2. The location of current time between 0:00 and sunrise is controlling the x position; 
3. Temperature is controlling the color; 
4. Presure is controlling the radius.

# Project1: Building Zobeide
![](/img/f2.png)

The story is from Italo Calvino's book Invisible Cities. In a chapter of Cities & Desire, a story of Zobeide goes like this: some men had the same dream of a naked woman running at night through an unknown city. They dreamed of pursuing her but each of them lost her. The next day, they decided to build a city modeled on the one in their dream but arranged spaces and walls differently, so she would be unable to escape again. Everyday, they went the same walk they did in their dream with the hope and belief they would see the woman, but no one saw that girl ever again, neither in their sleep nor when they were awake. At the end of the story, new men, who have also dreamed of the elusive woman, come to Zobeide and redesign it so that the woman will not be able to escape at the point where she did in their dreams. Original settlers cannot understand what drew them to Zobeide, “this ugly city, this trap”.

I read this story more than ten years ago and this white city and the running woman has been in my mind since then. I chose this story to be my project 1 without hesitation. I break the story into 6 main scenes according to the structure. To depict this white skein-like city in the moon light, I create a chaos of curves and geometrical shapes, and use only gray scale color in the whole story. I create an dangerous, unsettling atmosphere to amplify the greediness, blindness and selfishness of the settlers of Zobeide. I also made the experimental background music and voiceover to help render the story.

While making this program, I've had a lot of technical problems, like creating smooth transissions, triggering after a specific time, program running too slow, restart etc. I'm glad I have figured them out at last after a lot of trying and research. I think the overall visuals are satifying and translate the story well. One thing I think still need to be improved is that the visuals are very abstract for now, mostly because of the techinical limitaion. I hope in the future I could use more Class and hopefully more OpenGL to accomplish more sophisticated effects.

The question I have for now: is there a good way to incorporate animations in OF? Now I'm using PNG frames and display them in a looping cycle. I just feel like it's not efficient to make animation in OF if they're not abstract shapes.
